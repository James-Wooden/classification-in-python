# Smart Thermostat Override Prediction

[View the full analysis](https://james-wooden.github.io/classification-in-python/Classification.html)

This project uses multiple classification models to predict when smart thermostat users will override pre-programmed temperature settings based on environmental factors and thermostat configurations.

**Techniques Used:** Logistic Regression, Random Forest, model comparison and evaluation

**Key Findings:** 
- Users are predominantly cost-conscious, lowering heat in winter and raising cooling setpoints in summer
- Logistic regression model recommended for production deployment due to interpretability while maintaining strong predictive performance

**Business Impact:** Model can improve user satisfaction by learning preferences and reducing unnecessary overrides
