This project uses multiple classification models to predict if a smart thermostat user will override the pre-programmed temperature setting.

The data consist of environmental factors, thermostat settings, and “Override”, indicating that an override temperature has been set. Can a prediction be made as to when the user decides the thermostat is wrong and inputs his or her own setting?

The key finding for the project was that the user is most likely cost-conscious, lowering the heat during the winter, and raising the cool setpoint during the summer. A logistic model could be used in production to improve user satisfaction.
